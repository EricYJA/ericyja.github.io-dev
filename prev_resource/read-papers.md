From a general view, I would abstract the process reading papers to 3 steps. The fist step is to grab the general picture and the key idea. Then, one should get the main content of the paper and understand what the author is trying to do. At last, if necessary, go through the paper and check the code. Reimplement and redo the experiments proposed by the user.

## First View

Go through the paper in a short period. Gain an abstracted view of the paper. In this step, try to follow the following steps.

1. Read **title**, **abstract**, and **introduction**.
2. Read the first line and the core sentence for each part. 
3. Go through the math part (if applicable) to check the theory fundemental. 
4. Read the conclusion/result.
5. Circle the core reference.

Then, try to answer the following question:

1. Category: what kind of research is conducted by this paper? (Measurement/Analysis/Description)
2. Background: what are the closely connected paper? which theory could act as the fundemental?
3. Correctness: Are the hypothetic available? effective?
4. Contribution: What is the main contribution of this paper?
5. Clearity: Is the paper stated in a proper way?

Answer the 5 questions to decide if this paper is worth reading. Make the choice with your own understanding.

## Second View

Go through the paper in a meticulous manner. Ingore details like proving, and mark the technical terminology. Try to follow the steps below.

1. Check the **charts**, **table**, and other visual result presented. Think if this  kind of statical representation is meaningful, and one can get if this paper is a comprehensive work or not from the chart made and the mistakes in the paper. 
2. Mark the related reference for further reading. It's a good way to understand the background of the paper. 

For this time, one is expected to read the paper for more than one hour. Then, one should gain a concise view on the following things. 

- Fully understand the content. Be able to conculde and interpretate the formula, lemma etc. 

This kind of understanding could be applied to the paper that is not one's expertise but one holds great interest on it. If you find the paper's key points  are still hard to get. Try to put it aside, read other related paper, or just continue to read it for more times.

## Third View

When finding the paper is worthy, one shoud try to reimplement or reformulate the paper's core idea. 

1. Make similiar assumption to the paper and redo experiments on it. 
2. Compare your experiment with the paper's experiment, highlight the innovation point and check the flaws. 
3. Focus on the detail, try to verify every assumption proposed. 
4. Think beyond the paper and do your own ablation study. 
5. Combine your work with the paper's idea to see of you can learn from it and propose something speial. 
6. Conclude the techniques and effective ideas used. Articulate thoughts on the future research. 

For beginners, reimplementation could take hours or even days. Try to formulate the structure of the paper and mark the pros/cons. The most important thing is the techniques to check the background assumption, supporting papers, and potential problems.
